  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>LBolognese is a rich and hearty Italian meat sauce originating from Bologna, typically served with pasta. This savory sauce features a combination of ground beef and pork, slowly simmered with a medley of aromatic vegetables such as onions, carrots, and celery. These vegetables are finely chopped and sautéed in olive oil, providing a flavorful base for the meat. The sauce is then enriched with a splash of white wine, which adds depth and complexity, followed by the addition of crushed tomatoes and a touch of tomato paste for a robust, tangy flavor.</p>

  <p>A key element of authentic Bolognese is the incorporation of milk or cream, which lends a unique richness and smooth texture to the sauce. This creamy addition balances the acidity of the tomatoes and creates a velvety consistency. The sauce is seasoned with a blend of Italian herbs, salt, and pepper, and left to simmer gently for several hours, allowing the flavors to meld beautifully. Served over freshly cooked pasta, such as tagliatelle or pappardelle, and topped with a generous sprinkle of Parmesan cheese, Bolognese is a comforting and satisfying dish that showcases the essence of Italian culinary tradition.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
    <li>1 carrot, finely chopped</li>
    <li>1 celery stalk, finely chopped</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>250 grams ground beef</li>
    <li>250 grams ground pork</li>
    <li>125 milliliters dry white wine</li>
    <li>1 can (400 grams) crushed tomatoes</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
    <li>250 milliliters whole milk or cream</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    <li>Freshly grated Parmesan cheese for serving</li>
    <li>Pasta of your choice (such as tagliatelle or pappardelle)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.</li>
  <li>Add the finely chopped onion, carrot, and celery. Sauté until the vegetables are softened, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
  <li>Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes until fragrant.</li>
  <li>Add the ground beef and ground pork to the skillet. Cook until the meat is browned, breaking it up with a spoon as it cooks.</li>
  <li>Pour in the white wine and simmer until it has mostly evaporated, about 5 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes and tomato paste. Mix well to combine.</li>
  <li>Add the milk or cream, dried oregano, and dried basil. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
  <li>Reduce the heat to low and let the sauce simmer gently for at least 1.5 to 2 hours, stirring occasionally. The longer it simmers, the more the flavors will develop.</li>
  <li>While the sauce is simmering, cook your pasta according to the package instructions.</li>
  <li>Once the sauce is ready and the pasta is cooked, serve the Bolognese sauce over the pasta.</li>
  <li>Top with freshly grated Parmesan cheese and serve hot.</li>
</ol>
