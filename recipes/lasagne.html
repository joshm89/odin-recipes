  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Lasagne is a beloved Italian dish renowned for its rich, comforting layers of flavors and textures. It features tender lasagne noodles, which serve as the foundation for alternating layers of savory meat sauce and creamy cheese filling. The meat sauce, often made with ground beef or Italian sausage, is simmered with tomatoes, garlic, onions, and a blend of aromatic herbs, creating a robust and hearty flavor profile. The cheese filling, typically a mixture of ricotta cheese, Parmesan, and eggs, adds a creamy and slightly tangy contrast to the meat sauce, enhanced with freshly chopped parsley for a burst of freshness.</p>

  <p>The lasagne is then crowned with a generous topping of mozzarella and Parmesan cheese, which melt and turn golden brown during baking, forming a deliciously gooey and slightly crispy top layer. When baked to perfection, the dish showcases beautifully distinct layers that meld together to create a harmonious blend of tastes and textures. The tender pasta, rich meat sauce, and creamy cheese filling make lasagne a quintessential comfort food that is both satisfying and indulgent, perfect for family gatherings and special occasions.</p>
